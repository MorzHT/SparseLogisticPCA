SparseLogisticPCA
=================
This is an implementation of the sparse logistic PCA algorithm from "[Sparse logistic principal components analysis for binary data](http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&version=1.0&verb=Display&handle=euclid.aoas/1287409387)" by Lee, Huang, and Hu (2010). 

It uses the uniform bound for the log likelihood.
